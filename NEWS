# perfidy news

## 0.0.2 (2013-10-05)

Include Allen Short's implementation of `frozendict`, with his permission,
from his project [perseus](http://code.launchpad.net/~washort/+junk/perseus).

## 0.0.1 (2013-05-24)

Fork from [extras](https://github.com/testing-cabal/extras), because 'extras'
is a poor name, and because I want to just pile stuff into this.
