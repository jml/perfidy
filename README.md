# perfidy

A library adding some important data structures and generic functions to
Python.

Also contains some code to improve Python's reflection tools.

## Warning & invitation

This is in very early, experimental stages.  In particular, the API is likely
to change without notice.  There is no guarantee that this package will be
maintained.

However, if you are interested in providing Python with decent immutable
types, then your help would be greatly appreciated.
